/*
Power Grid Monitoring - Computing Diagonal Load Balances
In a power distribution center, the load levels are monitored and recorded in a grid-like structure
to analyze how power is being distributed across different regions. The grid is represented as an nÃ—n matrix,
where each element represents the load level at a specific point in the grid.

The engineers are interested in efficiently calculating the sum of load levels along the two main diagonals:

Primary diagonal: From the top-left to the bottom-right.
Secondary diagonal: From the top-right to the bottom-left.
Write a program to compute the sum of the load levels along both diagonals.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, nnn (the size of the square matrix).
The next nnn lines contain nnn integers each, representing the load levels in the grid.

Output Format
Print two integers: the sum of the primary diagonal and the sum of the secondary diagonal, separated by a space.
Sample Input

8 6 4
1 9 7

Sample Output
